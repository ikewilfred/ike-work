            While the equipment is <br/>necessary for both public and personal health, <br/>there's one glaring issue in the US right now concerning PPE: a major shortage and its putting any one who comes <br/>into contact with COVID-19 patients at risk
        </p>
         <p>
            Dr. Pischel echoes this: “As the world has been treating cases from this pandemic, <br/>a lot of PPE has been used up. This creates a great stain on <br/>supply chains with resulting significant shortages of PPE with different regions <br/>impacted more severely than others,” she explains. “Many health systems are starting to ration PPE <br/>because this pandemic will likely go on for some time so we need to save PPE <br/>for several weeks to months for now in order to avoid a situation where there <br/>is no PPE at all.
